# Dothraki Translator
## A bidirectional translation system for Dothraki and English

This repo contains the source code for www.dothrakitranslator.com

NOTE: Dothraki (being a conlang) has a rather limited vocabulary. Put yourself in the mindset of a member of a nomadic, horse-centered culture when asking for translations. For obvious reasons, the system will be unable to translate things like "computer" and "nuclear fusion."

* TASK LIST:  
  - [ ] reconfigure so that translation engine starts on page load and listens continuously for translation queries. Right now it has to start fresh each time a translation is requested, creating horrible lag times.
